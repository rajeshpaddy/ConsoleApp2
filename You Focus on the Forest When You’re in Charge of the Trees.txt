 Those with power are thus expected to experience more positive emotion, to be less inhibited, and to
  perceive their environment as less threatening and more rewarding than are those without power

  Those with power generally think about the social world in a less effortful, less deliberate, more heuristic, 
  and more top-down fashion than those without power. However, the idea that the social cognition of those in power
   is more automatic has never been directly tested

 However, the idea that the social cognition of those in power is more automatic has never been directly tested

 We propose that, rather than processing information less effortfully, those with power tend to process information 
 in a more abstract manner than those without power. The ability to see the bigger picture, to plan ahead, to keep
  an eye on higher goals, may be prerequisites for obtaining power as well as requirements for maintaining it. 

  When Person A can control what happens to Person B (e.g., Person Bâ€™s receipt of rewards and punishments) 
  more than Person B can control what happens to Person A, Person A is said to have power over Person B. 
  Person A is also less dependent on Person B to obtain what Person A want

  In this way, feeling dependent on others is associated with being powerless, 
  and feeling independent from others is associated with being powerful

  In contrast, when relationship partners become more emotionally similar, it is
   the lower power relationship partner that does most of the changing 

   Moreover, in any given social group, high-power roles are ordinarily held by fewer 
   individuals than are low-power roles

   Abstraction processing vs Concrete Processing - Information vs internal knowledge

   Thus, high-power participants focused more on primary information, a hallmark of abstract thinking.
